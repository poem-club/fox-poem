Whose fox is that? 
I think I know.
Its owner is quite happy though.
Full of joy 
like a vivid rainbow,
red, orange, yellowï¼Œgreen, blue, purple
purple, blue, green, yellow, orange, red
I watch her laugh. 
I cry hello.

Suddenly
There is a rabbit
coming into her eyes.
And the rabbit
jumping into her arms
She smiles
She laughs
She cries
She holds the rabbit.

And a wolf
Following the fox
